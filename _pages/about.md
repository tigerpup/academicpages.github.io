A Technology driven mind
======
I feel Technology as it is progressing should impact every aspect of our life. I am a sore believer of the philosophy to use Machine Learning and
Artificial Intelligence to improve aspects of all careers. This will give everyone a chance to evolve their skills to develope better services that
Feel more closer to our needs.  

Current Projects

I m currently trying to manage a running open source project of my own.
My Latest Project include Using Tensorflow by Google to read handwritten characters via android.
An Upcoming project is to build an hosted application that gives me the ability to have my own private
cloud-like storage system where I can store important documents and information
that I don't want to store on public cloud.You can read it further on my blog
posts.
